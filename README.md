Linked Ocean Data patterns
==========================

Introduction
------------

This document shows the results from the Semantics Smackdown held at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, June 2014 as part of the Ocean Data Interoperability Platform project. During the final two days of this workshop, an approach to linking data using a generic pattern was discussed. This was driven by the use cases of interoperability
