Linked Ocean Data - Semantics Smackdown
=======================================

Introduction
------------

This document shows the results from the Semantics Smackdown held at 
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, June 2014 as part of the Ocean Data 
Interoperability Platform project. During the final two days of this 
workshop, an approach to linking data using a generic pattern was discussed. 
This was driven by the use cases of interoperability between data 
repositories in the ocean sciences domain and also between ocean sciences data 
repositories and those from other domains. Therefore, the approach taken to 
modelling Linked Ocean Data was to use high level terms from ontologies and 
vocabularies which are well understood in a range of communities (for example 
[PROV][prov] and Observations and Measurements, [O&M][om]) while maintaining the 
references to domain specific ontologies (such as the Ocean Data Ontology, 
[ODO][odo]).

Cruise
------
A cruise is a discrete deployment of a platform (normally a research vessel)
which has a trajectory from a port to another, or returning to the port of 
departure. The cruise itself is not a geographic feature, its trajectory is,
therefore an intermediate resource for the trajectory must be instantiated to
which the geometry can be assigned. The linkage is made using classes and
properties from the [OceanLink][] ontology. For the European partners within
the Ocean Data Interoperability Platform, a cruise has been declared as an
Environmental Monitoring Activity, and a platform as an Environmental Monitoring
Facility. This allows for compatibility with the Environmental Monitoring
Facilities ([EF][EF]) theme of the European Commission's INSPIRE spatial data
directive.

Dataset
-------
During the workshop, dataset entities were deemed to have been generated by
cruise activities. However, there are use cases in operational modes (such
as in [SAMOS][samos]) where the cruise (a single port-to-port deployment of 
a platform, such as a research vessel) is not known. In this case we 
recommend that a PROV activity is created for a given calendar day's activity
on that platform instead of a full cruise instance. This day's activity may
later be mapped to a, for example, R2R cruise instance.

The use of prov:wasAttributedTo and odo:fromInstrument to link a dataset to 
the collecting instrument is optional, is repeatable (i.e. it is a one-to-many
relationship) and no rank or instrument order should be inferred from the use
of these properties. Similarly, the use of odo:hasObservedProperty to state 
the discovery level descriptions of the observed properties within a dataset is
both optional and repeatable.

Geometry
--------
AS per the guidance for best practice which emerged from the joint 
[World Wide Web Consortium][W3C]/[Open Geospatial Consortium][OGC] 
[Linking Geospatial Data][lgd14] workshop, geometries are given their own URIs
so they may be reused, and are not part of the metadata for their feature. For
a cruise, the cruise has a trajectory which is the feature and the track of
that trajectory is the geometry.

Observation
-----------
Observations are built from the [O&M][om] data model, and we can easily model the 
Observed Properties from the [BODC Parameter Usage Vocabulary][P01], procedure
from the [SeaVoX Device Catalogue][L22] and result from the relevant data file, 
which forms part of the dataset resource. [Datasets][Dataset] are linked to 
[Observations][Observation] through both the Result and the Feature of Interest.

Temporal Entity
---------------

In order to encode temporal entities associated with cruise deployment dates 
and with project dates, we chose to implement the Temporal Entity objects
from OWL Time. An example encoding of a Temporal Entity is shown below.
